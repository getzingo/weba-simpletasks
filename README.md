# Charm - Simple Tasks

This is a fork for the course **"Web-Architekturen"**.
This should serve as a guide for assessing colleagues, to install this App and get it running as easy as possible.

This was tested on a fresh Debian 12 machine.

## Step 1: Install Meteor on local machine

```bash
# As standard user
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl git

# Instructions from nvm repo (current latest version)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

# latest version of node
nvm install node
npx meteor
export PATH="$HOME"/.meteor:$PATH

# If you don't yet have a ssh key, generate one:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```


## Step 2+3: Run SimpleTasks

Also includes changes of the navbar-logo and changes of the colors of the gradients.

These changes are:

```jsx
//// ui/pages/tasks/tasks-page.jsx
// -
bgGradient="linear(to-l, #675AAA, #4399E1)"
// +
bgGradient="linear(to-l, #B54343, #8566B3)"


//// ui/pages/tasks/components/task-form.jsx
// -
bg="blue.600"
// +
bg="telegram.700"


//// ui/common/components/navbar.jsx
// -
bgGradient="linear(to-l, #675AAA, #4399E1)"
// +
bgGradient="linear(to-l, #B54343, #8566B3)"

// -
Simple Tasks
// +
 /\/\
````

```bash
# As standard user
git clone https://github.com/getzingo/weba-simpletasks.git
cd weba-simpletasks

# Optional, but following course instructions,
# adding changes to color them and logo
cp ui/common/components/navbar.gez.jsx ui/common/components/navbar.jsx
cp ui/pages/tasks/components/task-form.gez.jsx ui/pages/tasks/components/task-form.jsx
cp ui/pages/tasks/tasks-page.gez.jsx ui/pages/tasks/tasks-page.jsx

# Dependencies
meteor npm install

# Because this is not ran on localhost, we want to expose it via
# IP-address of the virtual machine, after successfull launch
# address will be displayed in the Meteor shell output
meteor --port $(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'):5000
```

This exposes the app to your VM's primary IP so itâ€™s accessible externally; if running locally, use --port 5000.

If there is no firewall in place, you should be able to reach the simpletasks app at port 5000.

Ctrl + C to stop the process.


## Step 4: Deploy on AWS EC2 via Meteor Up

Now that there is a working local version of the webapp, let's deploy it on AWS.

### Create Instance

Optional: get your local public ssh-key with `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`

1. Create new EC2 Instance on AWS Management Console:
  - OS: Debian 12
  - Type: t2.micro
  - Drive capacity: >10GB
  - Security Group: allow ssh, http, https
  - Keypair: (Existing Pair or the one generated before)
2. Create Elastic IP for public access
  - Under "Network & Security" -> Elastic IPs
  - Create new IP
  - Assign it to the new EC2 Instance
  - take a note of the IP, we need it later
3. Connect: `ssh -i labsuser.pem admin@<ip>`

ssh connection is essential.

### Create Atlas Account

- Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and register an account
- Create a Cluster
- Be sure to pick free tier
- Create user and password
- Add public IP of the ec2 instance to 'Network Access List'


### Deploy with Meteor Up

Meteor Up prepares your JS app, packages it into a docker container, as to make dependencies easier, and manages the deployment, even offering modular extensions.
We will be using the proxy module for letsencrypt and the hooks module, to automatically generate a nameserver entry.

To do that, you first need a few things:
1. Ssh privkey of the remote ec2 instance
2. Public IP of the ec2 instance
3. An Url where your tasks-app is going to be reachable
4. Mongodb Atlas Account and ultimately the connect string, should kinda look like `mongodb+srv://<user>:<pw>@url.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=blablabla`
5. A mailaddress needed to verify authenticity to receive a certificate with letsencrypt


#### Install Meteor Up

```bash
# still in weba-simpletasks directory on the local machine
npm install -g mup

# This created a .deploy directory with all infos
mup init
```


#### Populate settings

To simplify injecting the infos listed above into the mup config, add them to the top of mup-settings.sh. Do this via `./mup-settings.sh`

```bash
# go to the .deploy directory
cd .deploy

# verify settings
less mup.js

# Prepare the remote server, this installs all dependencies
mup setup

# If there are no errors, we can deploy the app
mup deploy
```

Now you can try to see if the app is reachable at https://<chosen url>.weba.ditm.at

#### Troubleshooting

Many problems are mentioned here at the [official docs](https://meteor-up.com/docs.html#common-problems)

I really only had one error during deployment, I solved with
meteor npm install --save @babel/runtime

# **Original README:**

Running with **Meteor.js 3** and Node 22.
Built with the CHARM (Chakra-UI, React, Meteor) stack.



## What and why this stack?
The main goal is to make development as quick and efficient as possible. To achieve this, I have selected these technologies:

-   [Meteor ](https://meteor.com/)- A full-stack framework focused on productivity that uses RPCs and Sockets for reactivity.
-   [React ](https://reactjs.org/)- A minimal UI library for building on the web.
-   [Chakra UI ](https://chakra-ui.com/)- A React library focused on simplicity and productivity.
-   [React Hook Form ](https://react-hook-form.com/)- Performant, flexible, and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation.
-   [MongoDB ](https://www.mongodb.com/)- A NoSQL database that is really powerful for prototyping and creating ready-to-use apps out of the box.
-   [Galaxy ](https://meteor.com/cloud)-  A cloud provider that makes deploying a server with a database included painless.
-   [Playwright ](https://playwright.dev/)- Reliable end-to-end testing.

## Tech Explanation

### How is the project structured?

Before explaining, this template is inspired by the works of [Alex Kondov](https://alexkondov.com/): [Tao of Node ](https://alexkondov.com/tao-of-node/) and [Tao of React](https://alexkondov.com/tao-of-react/)

Most Meteor apps are built similarly to a monorepo with their divisions for the back end and front end declared respectively in `ui` and `api` folders. You can have a common folder to share code between the front end and back end. For example, if you use TypeScript, you can share types in your codebase.

![Project structure](README-Assets/project_structure.png)

A good practice that needs to be pointed out is organizing the folders by feature so that when we think about that specific domain feature, we only need to go to that feature folder, and everything exclusive to that feature should be there.

We usually place things in the common directory when we have items that will be used in many places.

### Backend decisions

In this template, we have chosen to use Mongo, shipped out of the box with Meteor.js, and added some packages to make it even more productive. That being said, we decided to use `simpl-schema` and `percolate:migrations`. The first one is for validating schemas in runtime, and the second one is for creating database migrations.

#### Database Migrations

> Questions on how to structure your migrations?
>
> **Use api/db/migration.js as your reference**

* * *

This is the kind of feature that sometimes comes in handy. Whenever the server starts, it runs the code below located in `api/main.js`:

```javascript
import { Meteor } from "meteor/meteor";
import { Migrations } from "meteor/percolate:migrations";
import "./db/migrations";
import "./tasks/tasks.methods";
import "./tasks/tasks.publications";

/**
 * This is the server-side entry point
 */
Meteor.startup(() => {
  Migrations.migrateTo("latest");
});
```

It gathers all migrations that have not been applied and applies them.

A great use for migrations is when you have a change in your database, and you might need everyone to have at least the default data.

For more details, you can check [the package docs](https://github.com/percolatestudio/meteor-migrations).

#### Schemas

Schemas are a way to ensure that the data coming from the front is as expected and sanitized.

We have decided to use `jam:easy-schema`, attaching it to our collection as you can see in `api/tasks/tasks.collection.js`. By doing this, all data that goes into our Database is validated and follows the structure we defined. You can see how a Task is structured, and having that schema, we can start implementing methods and publications.

Don't forget to check [jam:easy-schema docs](https://github.com/jamauro/easy-schema) in case of doubts about how to use it.

#### Server Connection

Following the idea of having a folder for each feature, and if it connects to the front end, we need to provide a way to connect.

Meteor works similarly to [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) and [Blitz.js](https://blitzjs.com/). This model has server functions that get called through a Remote Procedure Call (RPC). In this template, calls that are related to tasks are in the `api/tasks/tasks.methods.js` folder.

```javascript
/**
 Removes a task from the Tasks collection.
 @async
 @function removeTask
 @param {Object} taskData - The task data.
 @param {string} taskData.taskId - The ID of the task to remove.
 @returns {Promise<void>}
 */
async function removeTask({ taskId }) {
  check(taskId, String);
  await checkTaskOwner({ taskId });
  return Tasks.removeAsync(taskId);
}
// ...
Meteor.methods({
  insertTask,
  removeTask,
  toggleTaskDone,
});
```

So in order to call this server method, we need to call it by its name. It would look like this:

This sample comes from `ui/tasks/components/task-item.jsx`:

```javascript
async function onDelete(_id) {
  await Meteor.callAsync('removeTask', { taskId: _id });
}
```

#### Subscriptions

MeteorJS supports subscriptions out of the box as can be seen in `api/tasks/tasks.publications.js`. These publications are called in a similar way to RPC methods, but their values are reactive. For more details on how to deal with and think in reactive programming, [Andre Stalz ](http://andre.staltz.com)has [this gist introducing Reactive Programming](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754)and [Kris Kowal](https://github.com/kriskowal) has [this Repo](https://github.com/kriskowal/gtor) that discusses the theory of reactivity in-depth.

> For using a subscription as you can see in our docs, is similar to using methods. In React we use meteor/react-meteor-data for having a react way of calling those methods

For a good example of Subscriptions, you can look in `ui/tasks/tasks-page.jsx`

### Frontend decisions

![Task Form](README-Assets/task_example.png)

#### React with Meteor is &lt;3

As for our frontend framework, we have chosen React for its productive ecosystem and simplicity. Meteor has a package for querying data using hooks, which makes you think only about bringing solutions to life.

For more information, you can check [react-meteor-data repository](https://github.com/meteor/react-packages/tree/master/packages/react-meteor-data#react-meteor-data) for more details on using the best of them.

#### Forms

As one of the key parts of the front end, we have chosen a library to help us deal with this piece. React Hook Form is a performant, flexible, and extensible library with easy-to-use validation. A good template for creating this kind of form is located in `ui/pages/tasks/components/task-form.jsx`. It is also integrated with Zod and Meteor by its call method.

Want to know more about how to create forms with React Hook Form? Check [their documentation](https://www.react-hook-form.com).

#### The productivity core: Chakra-UI

![Sign in Dark](README-Assets/sign_in_dark.png)

![Sign in Light](README-Assets/sign_in_light.png)

For our UI components, we have chosen Chakra UI because of its productivity that matches what Meteor does in the backend creating a lovely flow with an outstanding Developer Experience.

We have included Dark and Light modes. It can be seen those configs in `ui/common/components/ui-provider.jsx`.

You can see Chakra-UI's full component list on [their website](https://chakra-ui.com/getting-started).
